# Community DAO Governance Contract

## Overview
The **Community DAO Governance Contract** enables decentralized governance, allowing community members to create proposals, vote using governance tokens, and finalize decisions. The contract ensures fair and transparent decision-making while leveraging on-chain mechanisms for accountability.

## Features
- **Governance Token System**: Members use governance tokens to vote on proposals.
- **Proposal Creation**: Users can submit proposals with specific changes and a voting period.
- **Voting Mechanism**: Users vote based on their token holdings.
- **Proposal Finalization**: Proposals are evaluated after the voting period to determine acceptance.
- **Security and Transparency**: Prevents duplicate voting, ensures fair voting thresholds, and maintains on-chain records.

## Contract Components

### Constants
- `CONTRACT-OWNER`: The deployer of the contract.
- `ERR-NOT-AUTHORIZED`: Error for unauthorized access.
- `ERR-PROPOSAL-NOT-FOUND`: Error when a proposal doesn't exist.
- `ERR-ALREADY-VOTED`: Error if a user tries to vote multiple times on the same proposal.
- `ERR-VOTING-ENDED`: Error when trying to vote after the deadline.
- `ERR-INSUFFICIENT-TOKENS`: Error when the proposer lacks the required governance tokens.
- `ERR-PROPOSAL-FAILED`: Error when a proposal does not meet the voting threshold.

### Data Structures
- **Proposals**: Stores proposals including proposer details, description, vote timing, proposed changes, vote count, status, and threshold.
- **Voter Votes**: Tracks votes to prevent duplicate voting.
- **Governance Token**: Fungible token representing voting power.

## Functions

### 1. Mint Governance Tokens
```clojure
(define-public (mint-governance-tokens (recipient principal) (amount uint))
```
- Mints governance tokens for users.
- Used to distribute voting power among members.

### 2. Create Proposal
```clojure
(define-public (create-proposal (description (string-utf8 500)) (proposed-changes (string-utf8 200)) (vote-duration uint))
```
- Users can create governance proposals.
- Requires a minimum token balance to ensure accountability.

### 3. Vote on Proposal
```clojure
(define-public (vote-on-proposal (proposal-id uint) (vote-for bool))
```
- Allows token holders to vote **For** or **Against** a proposal.
- Ensures a user votes only once per proposal.

### 4. Finalize Proposal
```clojure
(define-public (finalize-proposal (proposal-id uint))
```
- Finalizes the voting process.
- If the proposal meets the required voting threshold, it is marked as **PASSED**, otherwise **FAILED**.

### 5. Get Proposal Details
```clojure
(define-read-only (get-proposal-details (proposal-id uint))
```
- Fetches the details of a proposal.

### 6. Check Voting Power
```clojure
(define-read-only (get-voting-power (account principal))
```
- Returns the governance token balance of an account.

### 7. Initialize Governance
```clojure
(define-public (initialize-governance)
```
- Mints initial governance tokens to the contract creator upon deployment.

## Security Considerations
- **Single Vote Per User**: Prevents users from voting multiple times on the same proposal.
- **Token-Based Voting**: Ensures influence is proportional to stake.
- **Proposal Integrity**: Only proposals meeting the threshold pass.
- **Time-Limited Voting**: Votes are only valid during the proposal's active period.

## Deployment Instructions
1. Deploy the contract.
2. Initialize governance tokens using `initialize-governance`.
3. Distribute governance tokens to community members.
4. Start creating and voting on proposals.

## Conclusion
This contract empowers a decentralized community to make collective decisions using a transparent and token-based governance model. ðŸš€
